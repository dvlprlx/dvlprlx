{dvlprlx.github.io/entries => readme}

Welcome to the entry's mission sets section. Each mission contains a set of days where each entries are written.

This part of the repository and the site's entry page are complementary -- they complete each other in a way that this
section is the file system and the site's page is where people navigate more easily.

The bad news for readers is that the style is rather boring and old, I intend to change that when I find the right time after
the first mission. (365 days of learning)
