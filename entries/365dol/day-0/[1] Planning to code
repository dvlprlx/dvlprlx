I decided to learn to program and make some cool projects in my free time, it would be so nice if I have something to put
in the projects section.

In order to begin, I need to pick a programming language to get started in this mission and my life goal which will be
revealed in another time.

I choose C because it's relatively simple and fast, a lot of sources said that it will make me less anxious of programming.

I'll read K&R C (ANSI C) and post the exercises in the projects section.

After reading K&R C and answering all of its exercises, I'll go make a cool program based on the book then solve some
exercises.

Then I'll learn C++ and do more programs.

I'll make a section where I put my resources to learn C, C++ and others.
