Welcome to the first entry of "365 days of learning", it contains my experiences in learning what I can learn in 2014 - 2015
which are my successes, failures, tips to get better and what I think of that resource.

As for introductions, I can't tell anyone my name yet but I can tell you that I am 15 years old as of 2014 and I live in the
Philippines.

This all started when I was grade 5 year 2009, the year I became aware of the cruel part of the world and the time my
attention span is low. When teachers teach, I doodled. Even now, I regret what I did, I should've listened but I didn't.

Now to solve that problem, I intend to go back to basics learning the subjects from the easiest to the hardest.

The first 365 days are just the beginning, I need another 365 days for good results.

I don't just intend to learn academic subjects but also harness the skills of an individual who I want to be, it needs a lot
of work but I'll do it.

I don't just intend to learn academic subjects, I plan to learn college courses like computer science to prepare for
college and do some activities that will improve my health and physical well being.

I am thankful that I have access to the internet. Coming from a family not rich but not poor and a country that doesn't
have the resource I found good, it's a relief to search the web for some resource.

Even though I download ebooks from the internet, it's still different from reading hardcopy books.

I won't post everything, I'll post what I find interesting.
